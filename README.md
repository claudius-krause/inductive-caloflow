# inductive-caloflow

Generation of calorimeter showers for datasets 2 and 3 of the [Calorimeter Challenge 2022](https://calochallenge.github.io/homepage/).

So far only tested for dataset 2.

## Idea

Split the problem into 3 steps and train one normalizing flow for each.
- flow 1: learns $p_1(E_i | E_\text{inc})$


## Usage
